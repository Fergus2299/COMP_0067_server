Hi all,
I've not included the node_packages dir in this repo so these are all the packages I've used.

- express
- cors    : API-database permissions
- mysql2
- nodemon   : reruns server on every file save
- sequelize   : ORM for interacting with the database
- sequelize-cli
- bcrypt    : module for hashing passwords
